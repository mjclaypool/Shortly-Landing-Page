### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This well-documented reference website helped me efficiently transition from vanilla CSS to Tailwind CSS. It is a popular CSS framework that promotes increased efficiency in styling applications.
- [Font Awesome Icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons) - This is pretty comprehensive library of classic and brand icons. It also offers various ways to add icons to your project, like via global import in React or copy/paste the svg tag.
